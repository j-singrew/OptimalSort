# OptimalSort
This repository contains a high-performance, hybrid sorting engine designed to achieve superior performance metrics compared to standard library implementations, specifically targeting the highly optimized Python sort() (Timsort) on large, randomized dataset

A great README.md for your Adaptive Sort Engine capstone project should serve as the project's face and executive summary. It needs to quickly explain what it is, why it's cool (the competitive goal), and how to use it.

Here is a comprehensive structure you can use, filling in the specifics as you complete the project:

⚙️ Adaptive Sort Engine: Beating Python's sort()
This repository contains a high-performance, hybrid sorting engine designed to achieve superior performance metrics compared to standard library implementations, specifically targeting the highly optimized Python sort() (Timsort) on large, randomized datasets.

🎯 Project Goal
The primary objective is to implement a robust, professional-grade hybrid sorter, synthesizing techniques from algorithms like Quicksort (3-way), Insertion Sort, and Heapsort (Introspective Sort fallback) to automatically select the optimal sorting strategy based on input array characteristics.

The success criterion is to demonstrate a measurable speed improvement over Python's built-in sort() function when benchmarking against large arrays with varied input patterns (random, pre-sorted, reverse-sorted, high duplication).
